**Dedicated to [ntina]**

<br>

This project is dedicated to a very special person in my life:  **NTINA** , someone who brings joy and light to every moment we share.

I created this heart animation to represent how much you mean to me and how my heart beats a little faster whenever you're around. ðŸ’“ðŸ’«

Thank you for being such an amazing friend, a constant source of happiness, and someone who always knows how to brighten my day. I hope this small gesture brings a smile to your face, just like you do for me every day. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’–

This is for you, someone who will always hold a special place in my heart. ðŸ’•
