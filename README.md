This project is dedicated to a very special person in my life, someone who brings joy and light to every moment we share.

I created this complex console heart animation project, to represent how much you mean to me and how my heart beats a little faster whenever you're around. 💓💫

You’ve been there for me during the hardest times, lifting me up when I was down and reminding me of who I  am. 🙏

Thank you for being such an amazing friend, a constant source of happiness, and someone who always knows how to brighten my day. I hope this small gesture brings a smile to your face, just like you do for me every day. 😊💖

This is for you, someone who will always hold a special place in my heart. 💕
